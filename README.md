# DevOps Challenge:

## Infrastructure problem:

You need to create one environment on AWS using ECS (ec2 launch type)
and deploy KONG API Gateway (community edition) onto it and expose the
service and management ports to the internet.
Optional: Configure a demo application to run on the same cluster and
expose the service via Kong.
